# Amigo Secreto (Secret Santa)

## Description

This is a challenge where you develop a simple application that allows users to enter names into a list, perform a random drawing, and determine who their "Secret Santa" is. It's ideal for groups of friends or teams who want to do a quick and easy Secret Santa game.

### Features

- **Add Names**: Users can add a friend's name using a text input field and an "Add" button. The names entered will be displayed in a visible list on the page.
- **Input Validation**: If the text field is empty, the system will alert the user to enter a valid name before adding it to the list.
- **View List**: All the names entered by users will appear in a list beneath the input field.
- **Random Draw**: When the user clicks the "Draw Secret Santa" button, one name will be selected randomly from the list and displayed on the screen as the "Secret Santa."

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling to make the interface attractive and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Logic to handle user interactions (adding names, validating inputs, and performing the random draw).
